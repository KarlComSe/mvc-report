## How to run the project

**Clone the repo.**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KarlComSe/mvc-report.git
```

**Install the dependencies.**

```bash
npm install
composer install
```

**Start local server or run locally somehow**

I've configured a local apache2 server to run the project, please see the documentation on how to install it and configure a server on your system. It should be possible to run using other methods, such as the built-in PHP server, but I have not tested it.

## Course highlights

### KMOM02: A deck of cards
Within part 2 of the course, the assignment was related to OO programming, specifically to try some OO concepts and to develop a deck of cards, an API and so forth. The UML diagram is [available here](https://www.yworks.com/yed-live/?file=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/KarlComSe/b1cb96d9a29f219e45584552f672f959/raw/ca37c2a6b8354f8d14dbca1e8b515b0712e363d5/Untitled%20Document)
