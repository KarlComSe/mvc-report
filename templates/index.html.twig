    <h2>Quote of the moment</h2>
    <p>
      Within the book series Department Q, by Jussi Adler-Olsen, the main character is polce officer Carl Mørck. One of his assistants is Assad. Assad is of Syrian origin and still uses his local proverbs which sometimes puzzles Mørck. I asked ChatGPT to provide quotes, but due to copyright reasons, it could only provide paraphrased quotes. Here is one of them. (The quotes are available through an API and on this page, it is delivered through a service.)
